This projects aims to identify different social foci in an ego network
of facebook friends.  Social foci in a group will be one of the most
important node in that particular group.

We have used various methods to measure the importance of a node
such as betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and eigenvector
centrality.  We also plan to divide the graph into different clusters
using k­means clustering and then report centroid of each cluster as
foci for respective cluster.

Keywords: k­means clustering, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector.
