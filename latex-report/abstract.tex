This projects aims to identify different important nodes in an ego network
of Facebook friends.  An important node in a group will be one of the
nodes who will play a significant role in spreading of any information
among the group.

We have used various methods to measure the importance of a node
such as betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and eigenvector
centrality.  We also plan to divide the graph into different clusters
using k-means clustering and then report centroid of each cluster as
important node for respective cluster.

Keywords: kÂ­means clustering, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector.
